## 🚀 TODO List for Pneumatic Tube Simulation

### 🏗️ Gas Control System
- [ ] Add and remove gas molecules at mouse position via specific key events.
- [ ] Adjust gas molecule size dynamically.
- [ ] Implement randomized gas motion for realism.
- [ ] Introduce gas density effects—heavier gases move slower.

### ⚖️ Dynamic Square Weight Control
- [ ] Enable weight adjustment for dynamic squares.
- [ ] Integrate force calculations affected by weight.
- [ ] Visualize applied forces using vector arrows.

### 🔲 Static Square Size Control
- [ ] Adjust square size using text input or UI controls.
- [ ] Ensure collision detection when resizing dynamically.
- [ ] Maintain aspect ratios when scaling for consistency.

### 🔬 Physics & Chemistry Engine
- [ ] Simulate surface friction effects on movement.
- [ ] Implement pressure equalization behavior—objects move toward low-pressure regions.
- [ ] Consider temperature influence on air pressure (PV = nRT).
- [ ] Integrate turbulence mechanics for realistic airflow changes.
- [ ] Define a standard unit per pixel for calculations.

### 🎨 UI Enhancements & Structural Updates
- [ ] Integrate Manim for improved physics visualization.
- [ ] Show left & right air pressure values dynamically.

- [ ] Define a scaling system for object sizes to ensure accurate representations.
- [ ] Introduce real-time logging to track physics parameters and interactions.

### 🛠️ Additional Features
- [ ] Implement performance optimization for smooth rendering.
- [ ] Enable saving/loading system for user-defined configurations.
- [ ] Provide an interactive tutorial for better usability.
